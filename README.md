## Known Bugs

I spent more time than I desired reconciling two pieces of code: user profile, and the quiz results. The difficulty lay in getting them to display simultaneously. I could get them to display individually, but not together. Only when I reversed the order, setting the branch conditions first, did the two display simultaneously. Try it out for yourself. I'm sure there is an easier way. Any advice from others is very welcome in understanding this problem.
